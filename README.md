# Project Name

Insurance company app

## Description

This is an app to test my node.js knowledge. We are gonna take information off an WEB API, render the information in the backend with handlebar, create a REST API server, and implement authentication and authorization.

## User Stories

- **404** - As a user I want to see a nice 404 page when I go to a page that doesnâ€™t exist so that I know it was my fault
- **500** - As a user I want to see a nice error page when it's an internal error so that I know that is not my fault
- **Get user data filtered by user id** - As a user or admin I can get user's data filtered by user id
- **Get user data filtered by username** - As a user or admin I can access to user's data filtered by user name
- **Get all insurance policies list** - As an user I want to see all the policies linked to a username
- **Get policies details** - As an admin I want to see the insurance policy details
